# Power-BI_Sales_Data_Analysis_Project
I developed a comprehensive project in MS Power BI, creating different types of charts, and dashboard to analyse the data. This process involved several stages, including creating new measures and a date table, cleaning data using power query, modelling data using power pivot, data pre-processing and data visualisation.
